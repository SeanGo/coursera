An introduction to fundamental data types, algorithms, and data structures, with emphasis
on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Specific topics
covered include: union-find algorithms; basic iterable data types (stack, queues, and bags);
sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort, heapsort) and applications; priority queues; binary
search trees; red-black trees; hash tables; and symbol-table applications.
